# Visual Question Answering (Q/A) using BLIP from Salesforce

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing a Visual Question Answering (VQA) system. VQA systems are designed to provide accurate answers to questions posed about an image.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Visual Question Answering model that can interpret and answer questions related to visual content. The model combines techniques from computer vision and natural language processing to understand both the image and the question.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Any other dependencies mentioned in the notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visual_q_a.git
    cd visual_q_a
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install transformers
    ```

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `visual_q_a.ipynb` includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of Visual Question Answering and its applications.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
